# My Portfolio, Online

This is me building a static website that contains my portfolio! I've decided to do this as I start my journey on HTML, CSS, and Javascript August, 2022 (note that I've never done anything front-end related prior to this). 

I will try to make this look as good as possible!

The header of my page is inspired by a old Chrome tab extension I used to use: Momentum. Other than that, there are different influences from Android Material Design, Apple, Microsoft, and more. This is what I was able to create from basic HTML and CSS. Once I get better, I'll try to update it.
